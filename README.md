# ML4Trading

## Introduction

Using Python with necessary libraries to apply machine learning algorithms for trading. 

## Section 1

Download the previous stock data from Yahoo. Clean the data with Python library, Pandas and Numpy.


Use Pandas for data importing, filtering on dates, data plotting. Reading data from multiple stocks into the structure, Data/Symbol slicing, Normalizing. Deal with incomplete data entries.


Using Numpy to create numpy arrays, indexing and slicing Numpy arrays, and data processing on Numpy arrays. 


Perform statistical analysis of time series: Gross statistics on dataframes, Rolling statistics on data frames.


Data visualization using matplotlib.pyplot by histogram plotting of daily returns, compare different stocks by correlation in scatter plots.


Analyze portfolio with average daily return, calculating volatility: stddev of daily return, cumulative return, sharpe ratio.


Create models for buy and hold portfolio.


Optimize the model through the build of parameterized model on the portfolio.


## Section 2

Create books dealing with orders on buy, sell, market/limit and arrival time, executation time.

Using the Capital Assets Pricing Model, one of the fundamental discoveries/advances in finance to estimate how much a stock will go up or down, multiply market movement with beta for stock. 

Using CAPM to figure out ratio to buy/sell stocks, go long/short. Time scale, change allocations weekly to monthly.

## Section 3

Using Machine Learning algorithms to algorithms trading.
Methods:
* Linear regression
* KNN regression
* Decision trees Random Forest regression
